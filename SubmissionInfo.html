    <h1>Submission Request to W3C: SADI Semantic Service Design Patterns</h1>

    <h2>Submitted Materials</h2>
    <p>
      We, W3C Members <em>UPM</em>, <em>Stanford</em>
      and <em>??DTL??</em>, hereby submit to the Consortium the
      following specification, comprising the following document(s) attached

    </ol>
    <p>
      which collectively are referred to as "the Submission". We request the
      Submission be known as the <em>SADI Services</em> Submission.
    </p>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p><em>
The Semantic Automated Discovery and Integration (SADI) design patterns 
intend to guide the creation of service-oriented architectures (not necessarily Web-centric) that 
natively consume and produce Linked Data, and are therefore more intereropable with 
other Linked Data/Semantic Web resources.  As it is only aimed at defining service <i>behavior</i>, 
SADI is orthogonal to other Semantic Web Service technologies and standards such as 
OWL-S or SAWSDL.  We also provide a reference implementation showing how SADI has been applied to 
the creation of Semantic Web Services.  This implementation has undergone multiple successful scholarly peer-reviews,
and has been enacted by multiple institutions worldwide, including by individuals/organizations outside of the 
group of submitting Members.
